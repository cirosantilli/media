1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,690
Bitcoin inscription museum. I learned that you can write arbitrary data into the

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,290
Bitcoin blockchain, non-financial data. For example, images and text. And that's

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,090
kind of cool, because the Bitcoin blockchain is distributed to many, many people, so

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,490
it's very hard to delete the data. The question that comes to mind then is how

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,450
illegal does something have to be for some government to say "Bitcoin is illegal

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,970
in this country"? Are Pedobear memes illegal enough? What about nuclear

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,850
weapon designs? This is from Reddit, by the way, it's all speculation. CIA don't come after me.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,530
What about political memes? If you post a Tankman meme in China. Do they like it? I don't think anything is

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,170
illegal enough. Either there's always a better way to find illegal things or your

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,930
enemies have already saved any leaks that happened in their servers and

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,250
it is already too late. So I don't think it will ever get banned. But this inspiration led me to

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,610
really investigate things a bit and it's just kind of cool what I found, not

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,570
necessarily illegal things, but just people. Bitcoin started in 2009. In 2022,

14
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,810
Ordinal Ruleset Inscriptions, a protocol for writing stuff on the blockchain was created

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,810
and it became really, really popular. As you can see here, nowadays there are more

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,690
than 400,000 of such inscriptions, which are mostly images. So at this point, you

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,330
cannot see all of them, but in the earlier days, when Bitcoin was less popular,

18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,490
there were way, way fewer images. So my kind of obsession has been, I'm gonna find all

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,650
the images. Which kind of means searching in many heuristic ways, because there's

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,170
multiple ways that you can encode things. Is it a raw PNG? Is it base 64? So it's

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,330
hard to find all of them, but I'm getting close to it. And it's cool because I saw

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,330
what people put in there and I appreciated it. There was almost nothing

23
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,970
illegal and a lot of fun things. So basically, social media, it's basically

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,890
what they use it for. So fun tributes, like a Magic the Gathering and trading card

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,130
game card ASCII art. These are just two friends and they created the earliest

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,610
protocol basically for upload. And one of them is really cool, EMBII who replies on

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,730
Twitter and is really nice. It was cool to see what those people are doing in

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,530
the early days. So this is also an upload by EMBII. This is a photography

29
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,130
that he created himself. He just found a little art of a robot on the street and

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,090
took a picture of it and put it on Bitcoin blockchain. The idea behind it is

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,770
that this robot will disappear. This image will stay in the blockchain forever.

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,330
The art is a bit beyond just the image. It's where it is placed. It's placed on

33
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,370
the Bitcoin blockchain and this adds a context to it. It was kind of cool. Stupid

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,530
memes. Of course, part of social media. Love declarations. So this one has a novel

35
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,730
Chinese poem, Western man married to the Chinese woman. And ads. There's this

36
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,090
conference, GRR conference, "get your free GRR CON code". Oh, but where is it? And then

37
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,890
at some point, oh, we should remove the at signs because there's a bunch of at

38
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,610
signs. It becomes much clearer "OP_RETURN is your friend". So when I saw

39
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,370
this, I was like OH OH, like a little obfuscation puzzle. Yeah. So it was really fun to

40
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,530
explore this kind of things.
