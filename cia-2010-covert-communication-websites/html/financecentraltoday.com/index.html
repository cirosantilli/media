<br/>
Trading in stocks has existed since the 12th  century. It has come a long way from men sitting in barn yards trading in a  small community, these days, however trading on the stock market has changed to  an almost unrecognisable degree. <br/>
Global stock markets not account for an  estimated $23 trillion in money flows. Stock exchanges such as the NYSE, NASDAQ  and the London Stock Exchange are all market places for trading stocks on.  These markets facilitate the trading of stocks by bringing together buyers and  sellers.<br/>
Traders of stocks have many varied approaches to  how they invest in the market. Some traders are risk loving and like to take  large gambles when they invest in stocks. These types of traders who include  day traders like to ride the wave of the minute to minute fluctuations in the  value of stocks.<br/>
This allows them to make a quick buck by  constantly buying and selling stocks at a mind boggling pace. Although there is  the chance of making a very quick buck this way this type of trading also runs  the risk of making a massive loss. It is estimated that about 80-90% of all day  traders make a loss on the stock market each day.<br/>
However if like most people you feel you don't  have the stomach or the time for minute to minute trading, there are other  methods to investing in the market. For example value traders are a much more  rationale, risk adverse type of trader. They try to avoid the minute to minute  fluctuations of the stock market by ignoring all the announcements made by  companies and just look at the average book price of the stocks over a longer  term.<br/>
Value traders search out companies they believe  to be undervalued possibly because it just announced profit warnings and now  which led to a dumping of shares from the company. This leaves the stock price  below its average price. Value investors buy the shares at the depreciated price  and then wait for them to go up in value again.<br/>
Trading on the stock market can take place in  the traditional manner in which buyers and sellers come together on the stock  market floor and stocks are auctioned off. Buyers and sellers act on behalf of clients  who place order for stocks to be sold or bought. In recent years the  traditional method has been combined with an electronic method in which orders  can be placed over a network, or through the internet.</p>
