          <h1>What is Venture Capitalism?</h1>
          <p align="left">Venture capitalism is one of the things that keep business booming in the country. It is one of the ways that helps new businesses thrive and flourish. This is because, venture capitalists are forever looking for new and innovative ventures that can potentially yield big return on the long term. They are not much into businesses that are already flourishing but those that are just starting or those that are in need of restructuring.</p>

            <h2 class="style2">How Venture Capitalism Works</h2>
            <p>Venture capitalism is a system wherein a person or a company often referred to as venture capitalists invest money in a company or business exchange for a stake in the business or a share in the earnings, present and future, of the company. </p>
 <p>Venture capitalists are frequently the ones that provide funding for companies that are in need of seed money to start up their business. Often, they support businesses that have a high potential for growth and those that they feel will return their investments multiple-folds. Companies that have innovative ideas and products are primary targets of venture capitalists. They are also partial to industries that are into innovations like Information Technology, Biotechnology and the medical fields. </p>
 <p>Other venture capitalists focus on providing capitals for already established companies who are seeking to expand their operations while some rescue companies that are in trouble and those that badly need restructuring. There are also venture capitalists that go into buyouts and company takeovers but of course, these are just a few. </p>
 <p>Often, venture capitalists do not just provide money but also the know-how. They help fledgling companies start by offering their managerial, executive and marketing expertise. They can also provide the contacts in the industry as well as other business requirements. </p>
 <p>Venture capitalism starts with the business plan submissions, which the company seeking seed money can pass or the venture capitalist company can submit. The business plan should more or less include a description of the size of the target market, the people that will work behind the team, the technology and the product that the company will be offering, and the financial projections. </p>
 <p>It is also important to include a summary of the business concept at the beginning. Remember that these venture capitalists do not have the time to read through the rest of the proposal. Your summary will determine if they will be interested or not in your business. </p>
 <p>After submitting your business plan, wait for three weeks and then follow up with the venture capitalist. If you are lucky to make the cut, you will be scheduled a face to face meeting with the venture capitalist, where you can present your case in the flesh. This might help them make their decision. </p>
 <p>On the average, venture capitalists receive about 200 business plans in a month. Only about five percent will be invited for a face to face meeting; so make the most out of your meeting and present a case that they canâ€™t possibly ignore! </p>
