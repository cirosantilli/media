So much advice about bodybuilding diets is off the mark. There’s no point being diplomatic: much of what you read on weight training and bodybuilding sites about how much protein you need, what supplements you need, how you should eat and why, are just plain wrong. Bodybuilding nutrition is a science. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110106035241/http://weighttraining.about.com/od/nutritionforweights/a/muscle_diet.htm">&gt; more</a>

Committing to exercise is easy - All you have to do is say, "I am going to exercise!" The hard part is actually doing it when the time comes. Learn how you can keep yourself going, even when motivation is hard to come by. Many people quit just when they're on the verge of success at both making exercise a habit. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110106035241/http://exercise.about.com/cs/exbeginners/a/commit.htm">

There are also online support groups for a patient's family members or
caregivers. Swapping stories and information, or tips on care
techniques can enhance the effectiveness of the support that they are
giving. Family and friends are part of the fight, and need to recharge,
ventilate, and learn new things while standing by you. Having others to talk to about this experience can be very helpful, and relieve feelings of isolation and sadness.
