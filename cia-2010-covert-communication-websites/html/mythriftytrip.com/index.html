Budget hotels abroad were even worse.

          Fortunately, things have changed. As five-star hotels have ramped up their offerings, so have budget properties. Where once you were lucky to find a coffee maker in your room, you can now often find free WiFi, breakfast buffets, and heated pools. Even cool design and a great atmosphere are more affordable than ever."
