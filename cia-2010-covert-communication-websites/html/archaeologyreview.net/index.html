      <p style="padding:5px 5px 0px 5px;color:#FFFFFF;"> The history of Easter Island is rich and controversial. Its inhabitants have endured famines, epidemics, civil war, slave raids, colonialism, and near deforestation; their population has declined precipitously more than once. They have left a fascinating cultural legacy. </p>
      <p style="padding:0px 5px 5px 5px;color:#FFFFFF;"> The large stone statues, or moai, for which Easter Island is world-famous, were carved from 1100-1680 AD. A total of 887 monolithic stone statues have been inventoried on the island and in museum collections so far. Although often identified as &quot;Easter Island heads&quot;, the statues are actually complete bigs, the figures kneeling on bent knees with their hands over their stomachs.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101229120831/http://www.eisp.org/" target="_blank">&gt; more</a> </p>

        <p style="padding:5px 5px 5px 13px;color:#FFFFFF;font-size:11px;"> Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its primary buildings are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. These are located in what is known by archaeologists as the Sacred District of Machu Picchu. Peru and Yale University reached an agreement regarding the return of artifacts which Hiram Bingham had removed from Machu Picchu in the early twentieth century.
