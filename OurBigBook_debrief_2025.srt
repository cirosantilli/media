00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Hi I'm Ciro Santilli and just wanted to get a few things off my chest. I've been meaning to say

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,000
those things online for a while now. But many many things happened I got busy so before I

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,240
start my new job I want to take the chance to do it now. The first thing that I'd like to talk

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:38,960
about is the status of the failed mostly OurBigBook project so as a recap I received a one thousand

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:50,500
Monero donation last year to do the project for one year and I have done it mostly. That was about

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,040
100,000 pounds and more or less equivalent to one year salary that I would have had at the time.

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:06,040
I have already made a text post about this, but it felt like such a large donation deserved a little

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:15,160
video so, in summary, I did not get a single user for the project except myself.

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:26,040
This is somewhat expected, there are two things that I could have done: one is better tech

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,560
and the other would have been actually going after users by making content. Perhaps I should have done

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:42,360
content, but I did just a tech. Partly because I'm a nerd, and afraid of human contact. A little bit.

12
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,360
A little bit of laziness perhaps as well but the tech features were not easy and I do feel that some of them were

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,360
fundamental and maybe in the future one day they will actually lead to the project actually taking off. Maybe.

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:14,120
In terms of tech, I have focused on improving the OurBigBook Web website which is the component of the project where it's intended that multiple users

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,640
would collaborate on any subject that they want and it's basically the major innovation of the project.

16
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:33,240
OurBigBook Web has become much more stable and some of the features that I wanted that felt really

17
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,040
really cool and necessary I've done them. I've also done some which were more experimental and they took more

18
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,320
time than they should have taken because everything is harder than you think. But I did them you know.

19
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:53,240
Everything is harder than it seems at first and I greatly respect web developers.

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,760
Every time I have a web development experience it greatly increases my respect for web devs.

21
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,480
And my hatred for them for making such shitty frameworks at times. But also my respect for them. Yeah, it's not easy,

22
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:18,440
making a dynamic website. Besides the dynamic website I have also improved a little bit the static

23
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:28,200
website generation. I do feel that OurBigBook is a very good, at least for me, I made essentially

24
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:38,040
the perfect way for myself to take notes. I do think that was achieved and also the static website

25
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:47,160
generation is exactly what I wanted and the way you take notes is exactly what I wanted and one of the

26
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:56,600
major points which I wanted and I think I achieved is the ability for users to have one table of contents

27
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,960
with all their knowledge infinitely deep table of contents and where you can just go on and

28
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,480
go deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper (oh that's a nice apple) you can go deeper and deeper and deeper

29
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:20,600
into any subject that you want to any degree. And I do realize that part of the project's failure

30
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,680
is that this is such a niche desire that very few people, I imagine, want to take a subject and

31
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,320
rip the heck out of it you know. Just document everything there is to document on the subject.

32
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,080
But this is what I want and for quite a few subjects. And doing so for free you know. So this is a niche

33
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:52,040
thing. But I knew that from the start. And it's what we've all heard: that for user generated content

34
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,720
there is a very small number of people who generate a large amount of content and huge value. So I

35
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:08,040
knew that. The question is finding those people and convincing them that you have the the best platform

36
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:15,160
for them to do that on. Which so far I have failed. But there is hope that one day I'll manage to

37
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,360
convince someone. There is hope, we'll see. So that's a summary of what happened. I was doing the

38
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,480
tech tech features and I didn't really directly outreach to university students which would have been the

39
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:39,640
the primary primary niche users that I had in mind. And basically to acquire

40
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,600
them I would have had to, I think, help them study for the university courses. Which is something

41
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,280
that I would still want to try and do. Because the whole reason for me doing this website is that

42
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,640
when I was at uni, and at school, I felt it could all be so much better and better explained you

43
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:14,840
know. So I do think it would be, if I didn't need money, I might actually do that you know. I'm really kind

44
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:22,280
of burned out of doing tech features (without active users). If I had more time for the project I don't think I'd do any more tech

45
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:30,520
features immediately. I would really focus exclusively on building a community and yeah I would give this

46
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:42,440
a serious try. Which would be of the likes you know: go to a nearby university which I have I'm

47
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:52,200
currently in Oxford. But I'm moving soon. And then decide for a course like

48
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:59,000
mathematics physics, these are the obvious choices. And then pick the course and try to

49
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,360
help the students do the courses and learn the courses as well as possible. I did research this a

50
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,720
lot like what would be the best course to go after. And at least in Oxford the mathematics course seems

51
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:23,960
like the easiest choice. The main reason is because of how open it is. They're putting all their

52
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,200
lecture notes and exercise sheets online more and more. And that is something to be very respected.

53
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,080
And in some cases even the solutions, they're trying to you know upload solutions themselves. Which would

54
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:46,440
somewhat compete with what I would be doing. But I do believe that with a exclusive focus on helping

55
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,640
the students you know we would be able to create better educational content. And that's what I

56
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,760
wanted to to try, like exclusive focus on the students. Which is not what most faculty have of course they

57
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,680
they have to do research and they're extremely pressured for novel results. So

58
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:17,240
I do think if I had more time one more year it would be worth giving that a shot. I think it is risky

59
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,120
business. Part of me also feels that maybe I'd be wasting my life and I could be doing something better

60
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:33,720
as well. But I don't think it's something has ever been done. Some students have you know taken amazing

61
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,800
lecture notes and tried to cover as much as possible. But I do believe that being a student you're already

62
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:50,600
under so much pressure to pass the bloody exams that you know you can only do so much. So someone external

63
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,760
with a deep interest in the subject and a deep empathy towards the students trying to do that

64
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm not sure it has ever been done to the level that I might be able to do. So it is an interesting

65
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:12,120
experiment. So I did go to the mathematics institute of the university of Oxford, which I'm very grateful

66
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,480
for them being so open. They have a cafe downstairs and you could go into lecture rooms if you wanted you

67
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,760
know watch some courses. I'm kind of old I think they'd look weird at me but I'd get away with it

68
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,520
I think. so I do get you know somewhat access to the students and did work there many many times. So I

69
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,520
did get watch to their movements and understand more which courses they are taking. But I didn't directly reach

70
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:46,440
out to them. The bar is quite high right: they're smart. So I would need something quite good not to be

71
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:54,920
you know, so they don't think I'm completely weird and worthless. But, it could be met I think, and

72
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,480
if I had met the bar on a course I would want to try and advertise it. I don't know how it is a difficult

73
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:09,160
question. but I mean put a note in front of my laptop here's a solved version of this course X

74
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,880
link to it online any question talk to me for free. I don't know you know they have hundreds of

75
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:24,200
students maybe one or two pick it up and see that I'm amazing who knows. It's just a bit of a hail mary but

76
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:35,800
it should be worth trying. Another thing that I should mention is that my personality

77
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,920
is being lazy. I am the lazy guy that Bill Gates talks about, that should get the hard task.

78
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:53,800
So I never push myself to burnout ever and that has ups and downs. What it means basically

79
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,200
is that I just keep doing the thing if it's interesting for a long time you know. And whatever

80
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:09,720
I have a deep interest on eventually I get it you know but it's not fast. So it's not like I was

81
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:17,880
doing the projects 12 hours a day every day. But I did do it seriously. But I also you know sometimes

82
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,400
how to take time off to look after my family. Another thing that I did which detracted me a little bit

83
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:35,320
from the project was a few small not so small side projects. It is a bit ridiculous that I should do

84
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,640
side projects when I'm doing basically my dream project. But it is also part of my personality.

85
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:53,880
I just had to do this kind of thing, otherwise I get too too tired of a given

86
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:03,000
subject. One thing particular that I did was pushing the CIA Covert Communication Websites research

87
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,960
a little bit further. And that did reach the you know had a web article on the Daily Mail so I think

88
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,640
it was worth it you know to get my name out there, potentially reach new people.

89
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,360
But I was always conscious that I should be getting back to OurBigBook now.

90
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,720
It was just in this case I was doing that project a little bit obsessively because

91
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,240
it felt that it was something actually big and novel and it is I do believe one of my most

92
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,560
departed contributions to the world so far. So I think it was worth it, time will tell.

93
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:55,240
As for the future of the OurBigBook project. Immediately what's gonna happen now is I'm gonna

94
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:03,560
start a new job quite soon and I don't plan on doing any major features or content in the

95
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,680
foreseeable future. I will keep the website running and I plan to run keep it running for as long as I

96
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:21,000
live. It costs currently I think 16 dollars a month so I can handle that. And I will

97
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
continue to continue to use OurBigBook as my primary note-taking and publication mechanism.

98
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm flexible in the sense that if there's another place where it's better to publish things where

99
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,720
it will be seen, more likely to be seen, I will use that and perhaps just link it to it from OurBigBook.

100
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:51,400
But for broader subjects which other websites such as Stack Overflow and Wikipedia don't cover

101
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,920
well, which is basically the the gap that OurBigBook was intended to fill, then the bulk will go into

102
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:08,680
OurBigBook. So this is the immediate future. We'll see maybe one day I'll pick up some university

103
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,560
courses here and there and try to solve them, and see if it generates some interest. But not planning

104
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,240
on doing that immediately, I'm gonna be starting a new job and I want to focus on that.

105
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,560
About the new job, it is you know, still low-level tech. I will be moving out of Oxford

106
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:40,040
but the new location, in the UK, is also whole home to a major university, so that does open some

107
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,680
doors potentially. It's not very likely but there is a potential that this will help.

108
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:56,760
About potential future donations which, if someone is crazy enough donates to a failure such as me,

109
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:06,600
I have clarified on a text post I cannot accept anonymous donations anymore as I have for

110
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:14,600
this a thousand Monero donation, which is a shame but it's the way society works. There is

111
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,320
essentially no way of preventing money laundering if you allow anonymous donations. In my case for example

112
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:29,720
sometimes I think, wow like if I were a drug dealer and I just donated this money to myself, I'm currently

113
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,400
getting away with it. You know. I did program a lot and I have lots of GitHub comments I don't think

114
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:48,600
a drug dealer would have been able to. But I did get away with it, so far. As I made a text post about,

115
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,760
much earlier, Barclays had frozen my account for a week earlier, then I started

116
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:03,080
diversifying my accounts like crazy and much more recently they said: okay no more anonymous donations

117
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:10,520
or us will kick you out. So I don't expect that to be different for any other British bank.

118
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,880
So at least for the time being, while I will accept anonymous donations, I will not count them towards

119
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:29,400
if "I get X then I do Y calculations". I should also mention that although the amount that I

120
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,320
received was I mean amazing and extremely generous and I'm extremely thankful for it and equivalent to

121
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:42,440
a year's salary, of course when you do a failed project like this, it does put you in a worse

122
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:50,120
position than where you started off financially, a little bit. So for example my new job

123
00:16:50,120 --> 00:17:00,280
will be paid 10% less than my previous one, two years ago. So I do take a little bit of a

124
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,280
hit, and I have a family which I have to take care of right, they're amazing and they have support

125
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,600
for me to some degree. So that has to be taken consideration. So I wouldn't be able to take

126
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:19,800
anymore like one year's salary right, it has to be much more. So it's this is something that has

127
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,680
to be considered. So it cannot be anonymous and it has to be more than your salary I don't know how much,

128
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:35,640
and just besides the money, this also degrades employees confidence in hiring you

129
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,320
because you know if you're really good and you might be getting more money to do something,

130
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,800
I might you know work for them for a while and then leave, which of course understandably is not

131
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,160
not great for employers because you know bringing bringing people up to speed is a considerable cost

132
00:17:51,160 --> 00:18:00,040
and I understand that you know. But so asking for donations online does take a hit on your

133
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:09,880
employability. This time it was somewhat tough, I'd say, I didn't apply for any job, I only went for things

134
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,360
which I had some degree of interest in, which is low-level tech low-level semiconductor tech basically.

135
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,720
But even within that for which I have various levels of qualifications depending on the job it, wasn't

136
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:33,720
easy. I got like a lot of rejections. It's hard to quantify this kind of stuff but I do suspect

137
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,320
that this played a role, I have been asked "oh would you leave us if you should get another donation" and I

138
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,320
said "yes if it's enough I will leave you" obviously as with anyone. But in my case there is a greater

139
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,840
probability that this will actually happen. So these are things that have to be taken into account.

140
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Another contributing factor to the difficulty of job search is that I think a lot

141
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,680
of the world resources have been pulled into LLMs. I do think there's some merit to

142
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:13,720
that, I am quite excited about you know LLM usage in mathematics and really trying to achieve AGI. I do

143
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,480
strongly believe that you already have enough computational power for AGI, so what I

144
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,160
call and I think others might call the "hexaflop hypothesis" that once you have hexaflops

145
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,680
of computation that's enough to simulate the brain, because "how many neurons you have times

146
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,280
how many synapses each neuron has times how many times per second they fire" and that is a hexaflop.

147
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:44,120
So I do think there's a merit certain merit to going there maybe, to novel architectures not just

148
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:52,040
LLMs, but I'm not qualified in that and no one gave me a job on that. I did apply to some

149
00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:00,840
companies. I do feel that companies are very, they can only evaluate how many years of experience you have

150
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:09,240
and what's your university. They are not able to evaluate you know your projects meaningfully. So

151
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,080
this is also which is something that I have right. Being a top this year you likely end up in top 18 or 17

152
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:25,400
year user on Stack Overflow for example, which is a notable achievement I would say. But most recruiters

153
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,240
don't take that into account. My current job did actually so I'm very thankful to them. It's not the

154
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:40,760
most exciting thing ever but it is good enough and there is a genuine degree of interest in doing

155
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:48,760
it. I've concluded that what I really need is I'll insert here now the name of the this is American

156
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,920
fellowship which pays 800 000 for creative people [MacArthur Fellowship] but they have to be in the US but that sounded like

157
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,000
the right one for me.

158
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,320
I should also mention that if you want to make things easy you could just donate a "I can retire

159
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,440
type for donation". I will do exclusively open projects until I die, open stem projects until I die if that

160
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:21,320
happens. Half joking here [such donation feels unlikely] but I mean I would do that. The exact amount is a tough question, it depends on

161
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:30,200
taxation, maybe four million to be very very on the safe side. So after tax two. Housing prices are

162
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:39,400
crazy right now in the places where people want to live. One million pounds for a house and then one

163
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:48,120
one million to invest in S&P 500 and live forever. That's kind of the goal. Another financial remark

164
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,840
semi-jokingly but is that I also feel kind of bad falling behind my peers financially a little bit.

165
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:03,320
I'm not destitute but I'm falling behind the hard-working peers that need perhaps more money than me.

166
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:12,680
It's kind of sad. So moving forward if I get any free time which is not likely in the immediate

167
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,480
term but maybe as I settle more into my job, I would be interested into looking into some higher tech

168
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,680
things, and I'm what I'm most passionate about I think would be trying to achieve AGI, or a little step

169
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,840
towards it. It's just too mind-blowing the fact that we might be able to actually achieve it in our

170
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:41,720
lifetimes, it is just too mind-blowing. This was my broad intention since I was doing my

171
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,360
undergrad you know in 2012 and 13 I made some choices toward the direction but I didn't push

172
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:55,320
hard enough. I also made some choices toward GPUs in 2015-16 but again didn't push for long enough

173
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:05,880
slash hard enough. I'd be retired by now if I had. So, I what I mean to say is of, course there

174
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,560
is this AI boom, which kind of peaks my interest as well, but I do have a genuine interest in that

175
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:19,880
area which kind of predates the current AI boom. Just I didn't push it hard enough as maybe I should

176
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,440
have. got a little bit distracted with education, which is I'm also extremely passionate about.

177
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:35,240
Within that area two aspects which I'd like to research on are one is

178
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:43,640
maths and code generation, because it it does feel that my job is dumb, most a programmer's job is dumb

179
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,880
most of the time, and it feels so automatable and there have been major progresses. I haven't fully

180
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:58,360
evaluated all the code generation mechanisms yet, but the general feeling is sometimes you

181
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:06,120
one shot problems and it's like oh my goodness I'm so glad, but others and for more complex problems,

182
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:13,000
which involve more internal data, which the model has not been trained on, for those they fail and once they

183
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,400
fail the first time they can't move forward, so you end up wasting more time trying to

184
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,160
prompt, than you if you were just solving the problem yourself. But I do believe that there's

185
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,120
even for not very useful things like you know pure mathematics or Project Euler problems

186
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,160
you know coding / mathematics computational problems, I do feel that there's an extreme beauty into

187
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:49,160
automatically solving that, and it is definitely a way to measure part of our progress towards AGI.

188
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,880
I would also be interested in doing more robotics oriented things I did consider applying for

189
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,720
jobs in the area but again no one would hire me because I have zero experience, but I have done a little

190
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,280
side project on that and I do have a gut feeling like many other people that

191
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:17,080
maybe having some robotics intuition in your models is going to be key towards AGI. I don't know, maybe not

192
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:25,160
but feels possible and worthwhile exploring. So that's another area which, through simulations

193
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,080
because who wants to deal with real robots right that's for losers, so with simulations mostly I think

194
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:41,880
that'll be very exciting. I'm also quite excited by the potential of doing ARC-AGI problems I won't have

195
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:50,360
the time for that unfortunately but it is quite intriguing to me because it does feel like some

196
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:57,080
problems which are very easy for humans to solve, untrained humans, essentially, maybe

197
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:05,000
standard western high school students, but still computers are struggling to solve them so

198
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,560
solving ARC-AGI would be also pretty cool. But on the other hand also there are so many

199
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,440
early retired finance and big tech bros doing that already that I don't know if I should compete with

200
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:30,440
them [https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli/arc-agi-is-a-black-hole-for-early-retired-tech-and-finance-bros]
but it is a worthwhile pursuit I guess. If I were to ever do any more tech for the OurBigBook project

201
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:38,760
which is not what I would do initially, I don't believe that any tech unless you add AGI to it, is

202
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:45,320
going to be enough to attract users by itself, but if one day I were to add more features there are two

203
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,880
major outstanding features which would be quite cool to implement. They're not rocket science but

204
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:59,560
they are considerable which is what you see what you get editing and and being able to pull changes

205
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:08,040
back. So WYSIWYG would be you know both a local and the web maybe, something like Trillium Notes. I find

206
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:16,680
that pro project extremely interesting and feature wise so many interesting features, and maybe even

207
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:26,440
forking that, add support for OurBigBook markdown and restrict some of this less wieldy features. So that's one of

208
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:33,000
them, and that would greatly increase accessibility. For me it's not so bad because I'm so familiar with the

209
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,600
markup but when dealing with images for mathematical formulae, yeah I know having WYSIWYG even for me I

210
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:49,400
missed that. You know so I get it you know WYSIWYG is is worth one's time you know. And the other thing,

211
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,920
the thing about pulling changes back from OurBigBook Web so basically what that means is currently you can

212
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:01,880
write local files and push those files to Web, but if you edit on Web which is possible, there's no way to

213
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,240
pull those changes back and merge them without potentially losing your local stuff, so doing

214
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,400
that is would require to some extent implementing git or a git-like mechanism.

215
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,560
The initial version of OurBigBook was a GitLab fork, but I abandoned that, I think wisely,

216
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,520
trying to focus more first on the more innovative aspects of the project,

217
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:37,240
not get too bogged down git and existing code bases. But I do miss git now for that.

218
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:45,000
It's not so easy because locally you know on Web everything is split to the header and locally you

219
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,400
can have source files which have multiple headers, so this does require some thought it's not just

220
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:59,080
slapping git in twitter and end of story but it's not rocket science and could be inspired by git.
